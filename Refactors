Refactors

1. Persist information (standings, teams, their games) so that they aren't scraped multiple times

User requests information
First, check if it exists
If so, display it
If not, scrape it, persist it to the appropriate class variable, and display it

Your cli class should be referring to class finder methods
Example: 
User inputs for Missourie

In the Team class, build a method called .find_by_team
Team.all.select {|t| t.name = name}
