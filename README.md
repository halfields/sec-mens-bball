# SecMensBball

Welcome to SecMensBball. This gem displays the current mens' basketball standings in the Southeastern Conference. It ranks the teams (1-14) by conference record, and also gives the teams' overall record. Select a particular team and it displays a team page that has the scheduling data for that teams entire season, including dates, opponents, and the score if the game has already been played.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'sec_mens_bball'

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sec_mens_bball
